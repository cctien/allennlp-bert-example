English documents form the Parallel Meaning Bank 
tagged with the universal semantic tags 0.1.0
=========================================================


Introduction
------------

The universal semantic tagging is a sequence labeling task where
labels are language-neutral, semantically informative tags.  


About this release
----------------

This release is a frozen snapshot of a subset of English PMB documents that are marked as gold 
or silver standard in the current development version. The gold folder contains tagged 
documents that are fully manually checked, while the silver contains tagged documents
that are only partially manually checked. WARNING: use silver documents at your own risk!

The current release comprises examples that are certainly not representative for the entire 
corpus. This is because of the way they were selected: not randomly, but on the basis of 
quality of the semantic analysis. Nevertheless, this selection contains a diverse set of 
semantic phenomena, including: quantification, negation, modal operators, scope, tense, and 
referring expressions.

The current development version itself is made available via a wiki-like Web interface 
called PMB Explorer. Semantic annotation is a very hard task and despite thorough manual 
checking can still contain mistakes. If you find any errors in the annotation, you can 
either let us know (via the website) or, if you feel like, you can correct them yourself, 
and thus contribute directly to the PMB. To do so or get more information about the 
project, visit http://pmb.let.rug.nl

File Format
-----------

Every document file contains pairs of a semantic tag and a token.
A tag and a token are separated with the tab character.
Each tag-token pair starts on a new line and ends with the Unix-style newline character. 
The files are encoded in UTF-8.


File Naming Convention
----------------------

Each file has a name of the form p{PartNumber}_d{DocumentNumber}.{Corpus}.{Status} where:

* 'PartNumber' stands for the PMB part ranging from 00 to 99.

* 'DocumentNumber' is a number each document gets inside the PMB part. It ranges from 0000 to 9999.

* 'Corpus' stands for the three-letter abbreviation of a corpus name:
      'ttb' for 'Tatoeba'
      'rte' for 'RTE'
      'que' for 'Questions'
      'new' for 'News-Commentary'

* 'Status' is either 'gold' or 'silver' denoting the annotation status of a document
